Project Questions:
Research Question: How do various predictors (e.g., age, BMI, blood pressure, and serum measurements) influence diabetes progression, and how can Bayesian modelling improve predictive performance and uncertainty quantification?
Proposed Models and Model Comparison:
Model 1: Bayesian Linear Regression with appropriate priors for the predictors.
Model 2: Bayesian Non-linear Regression using smoothing splines to capture complex relationships.
Model Comparison: Models will be compared using WAIC and LOO-CV to evaluate their relative fit and predictive performance.
